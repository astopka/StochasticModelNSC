Stopka A., Boareto M.  “A stochastic model of adult neurogenesis coupling cell cycle progression and differentiation.”, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 475C: 60-72, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.05.014)

In this paper, we propose a stochastic model of adult neurogenesis based on symmetric division and a coupling of cell cycle progression and differentiation.

For the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data we used the public data set from Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2015.07.002) and the processed data was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67833.

For simulations and data analysis we used Python programming language.
